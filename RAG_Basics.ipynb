Leveraging a strong mathematical background and proven ability to develop\\n innovative solutions, I contribute to cutting-edge projects at Collins Aerospace’s R&D team.\\n     I have been recruited by an external company (Aero-Apparel, etc.) to work on various projects, including a C&C project for an existing company. \\xa0After a few months this project has been completed and I am looking for a contract. I did not choose this job. What is it like in a world with 100% artificial intelligence and artificial learning?\\nI work for the same company as my employer. We work together on our projects. In the beginning, the main focus is the computer vision project. The main task is processing data. During the evaluation phase, a team of four or five people, who work in different locations, work to solve problems. Then we work hard to find solutions. Once all the solutions are identified, we run the project, or work side by side, to make sure they are right. If there are any discrepancies, they will also be resolved. This is how it is. So, in the technical department, there is a lot of problem solving in front of us, like making a decision. When we start a project we don\\'t have time to think of what we can do to correct the problem. It is more like doing a series of tests and problems to get the right answer. As a result, you need to have the ability and skills to run a full-fledged project in your spare time. Since we are doing an automated project and only get results from the test, it should take only a minute or two to complete. However, if we decide to do a small project on an app, when we have all our problems solved properly, then after 10 to 15 seconds we get a perfect solution. That is why we decided to hire an artificial Intelligence Engineer. At the moment, he is only in his 20s and his job does not require any training. He also has a PhD in Computer Sciences and was a post-doc in Machine Science. Now, that we consider the role of an AI engineer, how will the position improve for him? How will he adapt to changing job, job type, company, industry and career?\\n\\n\\nIn the following interview, ask him the question \"What is your passion for AI in general and Machine-Learning in particular?\". In your next interview you will answer the questions in detail. Also, here is an overview of the interview. Please note that this interview was conducted using a Skype interview with a real-time AI expert, which was not possible for this person.'"
